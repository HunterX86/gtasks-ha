You may need to access your desktop environment to 'unlock keyring' which is where the refresh token is stored.

If the refresh token isn't working you may need to delete it from the keyring and setup the integration again. This seems to happen to me periodically
and I am not sure why yet.

FOR INITIAL SETUP
I added:-
gtasks:
  credentials_location: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/credentials.json
  default_list: 'My Tasks'
  force_login: false

Your OAuth Client ID must be of type 'Desktop'

The Homeassistant.log gives a google address to grant permission to the app, you will need to make sure that the log isn't limited to just errors.
Go to the google url and complete the steps. You will be returned to a localhost page look in the address to get the 'code' and
use the code to setup the integration, when added there is one empty unlabelled box put it in there. If you have a service running on localhost you may
need to temporarily halt it or else look at the request headers when you finish the google authorisation.

TODO is fix all this up so it happens much more smoothly. This all relies on gtasks2 which is still available on pip but which has been removed from github.
May need to go back to gtasks (not the 2 version) or else deal with the gtask api directly.
