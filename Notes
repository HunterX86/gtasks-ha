You may need to access your desktop environment to 'unlock keyring' which is where the refresh token is stored.

If the refresh token isn't working you may need to delete it from the keyring and setup the integration again.

The Homeassistant.log gives a google address to grant permission to the app. You will be returned to a localhost page look in the address to get the 'code'
use the code to setup the integration, when added there is one empty unlabelled box put it in there.

TODO is fix all this up so it happens much more smoothly. This all relies on gtasks2 which is still available on pip but which has been removed from github.
May need to go back to gtasks (not the 2 version) or else deal with the gtask api directly.
